        "query": "What are my rights if I'm arrested?",
        "response": "If you're arrested, it's important to know that the law protects you. The police must tell you why they're arresting you, and this is because of Article 22 of the Indian Constitution. It says that you have the right to know what you're being accused of. \n\nAnother thing is that you can ask to talk to a lawyer. This is your right, and it helps you understand what's happening. Section 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 also says the police must explain the charges against you. \n\nFinally, the police must take you to a judge within 24 hours. This is so the judge can check if the police are following the law and that you're not being kept in jail without a good reason. This rule is also part of Article 22 of the Constitution. \n\nFor example, imagine you're arrested for theft. The police must tell you that you're being arrested for theft because of Section 50 of the CrPC. You should also ask to see a lawyer, and the police must bring you to a judge within a day."

        "query": "How do I file a complaint against someone?",
        "response": "If someone does something wrong, like hurting you or stealing your things, you can go to the police and file a complaint. This is called an FIR, or First Information Report, and it is a part of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973. \n\nThis law says the police must write down your complaint if it's about something serious, called a 'cognizable offense' (like theft or assault). After that, they start investigating what happened. \n\nFor example, if someone stole your money, you would go to the police, and they would file the FIR under Section 154 of the CrPC. This starts the investigation, and you should get a copy of the report for yourself."

        "query": "What is the process to register a trademark in India?",
        "response": "Registering a trademark is about protecting something unique to your business, like a logo or name. The law that explains how to do this is the Trade Marks Act, 1999. \n\nFirst, you check if someone else is already using the same trademark. If no one is, you can apply to register it. The Trade Marks Act requires you to send in details of the trademark and explain what it's forâ€”whether it's for a product, service, or business. \n\nThen, officials will check your application. If no one else claims it, your trademark will be published in a journal for a few months to see if anyone objects. If no one does, it's yours.\n\nFor example, if you created a new logo for your business, you'd apply to register it under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. If no one else is using it, you'll receive a certificate saying it's yours."
