WARNING: The specified Android SDK Build Tools version (30.0.0) is ignored, as it is below the minimum supported version (34.0.0) for Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.2.
Android SDK Build Tools 34.0.0 will be used.
To suppress this warning, remove "buildToolsVersion '30.0.0'" from your build.gradle file, as each version of the Android Gradle Plugin now has a default version of the build tools.
WARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35

This Android Gradle plugin (8.3.2) was tested up to compileSdk = 34.

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35.

If you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 35 is available.

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35
to this project's gradle.properties.
